<h4>October 4th, 2022</h4>
<p>For this first assignment, it felt really nice to be able to start learning and instantly having a visible product with very little experience beforehand.
Though it's admittedly a very simple assignment, small steps build up to big strides, and this is only the begining of my webdev journey. 
The basic concepts of using html and css seem very straightforward, and I can't wait to implement these skills to bigger and better things. 
I basically knew nothing about html (besides my time as a middleschooler inspecting the html of almost every website I visited) so it was really nice to start building the foundation to wherever this class is gonna take me.
I've learned the skeleton of html and css can do, in terms of creating a website, linking pages together, uploading images, the deifferent text structures, and though I didn't use any css in this assignment,
I also learned how to start customizing elements and such. Overall, it was a very enjoyable process to go through. 
The biggest help for me were the lectures and provided google doc notes on how everything works, allowing me to go back and study on my own if I did not understand something in class.
Alot of the people in this class seem to have at least a little webdev experience before hand, which kind of scared me at first, but I know that in this coming term, I'll gain the skill to rival most all people in this CS 
290 class.
I ended up linking a stylesheet to my html document, though I decided not to use any css with this assignment. I'll for sure be working on this in my free time to get my css skills up though.

</p>
<p>All in all, I'm eager to learn more about the webdev processes and techniques to eventually make something that I'll either want to share with all my friends or to help someone out.</p>
